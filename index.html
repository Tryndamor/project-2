      <p> Hey, my name is Trevor! This is the one-page to rule them all. No but seriously tho, this is another project, but a more detailed one. 
        I've always been very big into technology, whether it was gaming or getting the most modern things I can get my hands on.  
        Learning code has always been an interest of mine and Im glad to finally take some steps towards learning it. Excited to get my hands on more in-depth coding styles!
