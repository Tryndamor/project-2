      <h1>About me </h1>
      <p> Hey, my name is Trevor! This is the one-page to rule them all. No but seriously tho, this is another project, but a more detailed one. 
        I've always been very big into technology, whether it was gaming or getting the most modern things I can get my hands on.  
        Learning code has always been an interest of mine and Im glad to finally take some steps towards learning it. Excited to get my hands on more in-depth coding styles!

        <ul>
          <li> I can now say Ive learned a bit more about what the internet is.</li>
          <li> The internet is a physical structure. Wires that span the entire world that interconnect eachother allowing for electrical impulses to send bits of information
            to one computer from the next.</li>
          <li> The world wide web is accessed via the internet. Its a string of hyperlinks that let you access and view webpages like this one or google.</li>
          <li> Ive learned that webdesign is made up of multiple types of code: Html, CSS, Javascript.</li>
          <li> Html being the structure. CSS being the design. Javascript being the functionality.</li>
